* By the final timepoint of the study it is notable a difference between the mice
  treated with Capomulin and Ramicane against the ones treated with Infubinol and
  Ceftamin, concluding there is a higher grade of effectiveness with the first two.

* The arbitrary mouse "b128" treated with Capomulin shows that between days 25-35
  it has a great increase in its tumor size. Proof of Capomulin's effectiveness from
  day 25 and on.

* There is a strong linear correlation between the tumor volume and the mouse weight,
  this is we can estimate with good confidence the tumor volume for an specific mouse
  given its weight.
